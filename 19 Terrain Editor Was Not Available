The tool selection for editors has changed so these videos were a bit confusing.
The assets she mentions are not available.
I imported Free Islands.
I also imported Terrain Textures Pack Free. (this is corrupted so go to All Prefabs and deleat the trees.)
Then I imported Realistic Trees.
I tried Mesh Terrain Editor Free but it wouldn't work with Unity 5.
There are all sorts of little changes: to raise and lower click brush and the bar below it.
To eddit texture choose open rather than eddit. And so on
Watching the videos gives me hints rather than instructions.
Saving the scene doesn't prevent the terrain from getting ruined so be very careful and make multiple copies of your game
control z wont always work
you might get this message
Failed to create Object Undo, because the action is too large. Clearing undo buffer
UnityEngine.GUIUtility:ProcessEvent(Int32, IntPtr)
I imported a water plane from the asset store. It was called MobileDepthWater and it is a bit unrealistic.
