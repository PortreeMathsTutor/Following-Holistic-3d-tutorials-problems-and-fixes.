The tool selection for editors has changed so these videos were a bit confusing.
The assets she mentions are not available.
I imported Free Islands.
I also imported Terrain Textures Pack Free. (this is corrupted so go to All Prefabs and deleat the trees.)
Then I imported Realistic Trees.
I tried Mesh Terrain Editor Free but it wouldn't work with Unity 5.
There are all sorts of little changes: to raise and lower click brush and the bar below it.
To eddit texture choose open rather than eddit. And so on
Watching the videos gives me hints rather than instructions.
