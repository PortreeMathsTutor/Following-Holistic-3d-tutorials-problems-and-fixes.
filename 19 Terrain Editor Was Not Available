I used Mesh Terrain Editor Free instead.
I also imported Terrain Textures Pack Free. (this is corrupted so go to All Prefabs and deleat the trees.)
Then I imported Realistic Trees.
Because I couldn't use the same assets as Holistic 3d I followed the custom videos Mesh Terrain Editor v3.3.2 Intro - Creator
instead.
