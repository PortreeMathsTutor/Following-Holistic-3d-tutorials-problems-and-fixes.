// In following part 9 I used the character contoller Full Body FPS Controller
// this character falls through the ground up to his middle.
// I moved the char_ethan which was in the Character Mesh up to position (0,1,0)
// the character just hangs there but the controls work.
// I put an empty gameObject on the Camera Contoller at position (0,-0.7,0)
// That was great because the empty game object follows the rotation of the actual camera
// and the Camera Controller transform doesn't.

// So the empty gameObject was attached to the Camera Controller which was attached to the FPS Controller
// and it was the empty gameObject to which I attached the script.
