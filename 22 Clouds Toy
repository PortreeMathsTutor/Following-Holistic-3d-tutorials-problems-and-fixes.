First I imported Clouds Toy into my project
this was a mistake. I deleated it and reimported it several times leaving out various things but it was no good.
I created a new project and imported Clouds Toy just as it it is.
The only error that came up was "creat a layer called "CloudsToy". so I did and put the clouds Toy assets in this layer .
After that it worked. 
Then I copied and pasted the folder and meta from the one asset folder into the other.
This worked.
I redused the size of the "Cloud Creation Size" to a little box that I could put next to my character.
It seems to work absolutely perfectly.
